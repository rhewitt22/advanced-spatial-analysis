# Roy Hewitt: Atlanta, GA

## Education

I received my B.S. in Environmental Science and Policy from the University of Maryland in College Park.  My concentration was in Climate and Land-Use Change with a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  I'm currently enrolled in the Master of [Geospatial Information Science and Technology](http://geospatial.ncsu.edu/education/programs/mgist/) Certificate program at North Carolina State University.

This course is called [Advanced Spatial Analysis](http://courses.ncsu.edu/gis520/common/index.html).  In this course we cover the main techniques for both vector and raster analysis.  This website serves as my portfolio.

## Professional Work

My first position with the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service was under the Chesapeake Bay Nutria Eradication Program (CBNEP).  I worked as the GIS Analyst along with 10+ highly experienced field staff who searched for and removed nutria, a small wetland rodent, from the Chesapeake Bay.  Although I worked for the Chesapeake Bay Field Office I was stationed on Maryland's Eastern Shore where I lived and worked on Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

Currently I work in the Southeast Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service in Atlanta, GA as a GIS Analyst.  I provide mapping and data management support to the Ecological Services program throughout the Southeast Region.
